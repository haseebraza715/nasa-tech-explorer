# NASA TechTransfer API

The NASA TechTransfer API provides programmatic access to NASAâ€™s portfolio of patents, software technologies. These resources are made available to support innovation, commercialization, and public benefit by enabling developers, researchers, and organizations to search and reuse NASA-developed technologies.

## Base URL

```

[https://api.nasa.gov/techtransfer](https://api.nasa.gov/techtransfer)

```

> All endpoints require an API key. You can use `DEMO_KEY` for testing or request a personal key at [api.nasa.gov](https://api.nasa.gov/).

## Available Endpoints

| Resource     | Endpoint                          | Query Parameter   | Description                                                   |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Patents      | `/patent/?patent={keyword}`       | `patent`          | Searches for patents by keyword                               |
| Patent Issued| `/patent/?patent_issued={year}`   | `patent_issued`   | Filters patents by issuance details (e.g., year)              |
| Software     | `/software/?software={keyword}`   | `software`        | Searches NASA-developed software tools and platforms          |

## Example Request

Search for patents related to "engine":

```

GET [https://api.nasa.gov/techtransfer/patent/?patent=engine\&api\_key=DEMO\_KEY](https://api.nasa.gov/techtransfer/patent/?patent=engine&api_key=DEMO_KEY)

````

### Example Response (truncated):

```json
{
  "results": [
    [
      "MSC-25644-1",
      "Multifuel Capable Engine with Low NOx Emissions",
      "A multifuel internal combustion engine system that reduces nitrogen oxide emissions...",
      ...
    ]
  ]
}
````
